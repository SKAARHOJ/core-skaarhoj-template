# core-skaarhoj-template

This is a basic template for an SKAARHOJ devicecore written in golang


## Getting started with development

1) Replace all usages of core-skaarhoj-template with your own name of this devicecore, including the go.mod file
2) Adjust the general info and metadata in main.go
3) (Optional: define different models if you have more than 1 different device to support)
4) define and configure your parameter structures in parameters.go, you can have different configs per model in case that is needed
5) Finally do your implementation in process.go . Feel free to structure it as you like
